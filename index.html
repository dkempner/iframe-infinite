    <h1>Iframe Infinite Loop Demo</h1>
    <p>
      The iframe below will attempt to run an infinite while loop. In modern
      browsers, this may cause high CPU usage and potentially crash the iframe
      process independently.
    </p>

    <iframe
      src="infinite-loop.html"
      width="600"
      height="300"
      sandbox="allow-scripts"
    ></iframe>

    <p>
      You can monitor your browser performance to see the CPU behavior, but be
      cautious as it could make the iframe unresponsive or crash.
